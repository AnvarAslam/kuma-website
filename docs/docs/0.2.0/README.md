# Welcome to Kuma

Kuma is a modern and easy to use L4/L7 traffic management platform for Service Mesh and Microservices.

Built on top of Envoy, Kuma ships with a fast Data Plane (DP) and Control Plane (CP) that are meant to be used by the entire organization, and that can run on any platform to build modern cloud-native architectures: run on Kubernetes, VMs and any cloud vendor in a breeze.

Built by Envoy contributors at Kong ü¶ç.
